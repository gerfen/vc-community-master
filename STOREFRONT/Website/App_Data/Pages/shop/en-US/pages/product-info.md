                <div id="question_1" class="answer collapse">
                <p>1. Remove the existing head by removing each lug with the included drum key. Turn each lug counter clockwise until you can easily remove the drum head. As you remove the head, alternate between lugs. For instance, if you start loosening a lug at the top of the bass drum, don’t loosen the lug that is next to it. Instead, loosen the lug that is diagonal across from it on the opposite side of the drum. This allows the head to be tightened evenly and will prevent tuning problems later on.</p>
                <p>2. Remove the ring that held the bass drum head in place and set it aside, then dispose of the old head.</p>
                <p>3. Hold the new bass drum head firmly in place over the bass drum, then place the metal ring around the bass drum to hold it in place while you fasten the drum head. Start the tension rods with your fingers to assure no cross threading. To tighten down the drum head, repeat Step 2, but turn the lugs clockwise until the drum head is evenly tightened. You need to only tighten it until the wrinkles disappear.</p>

                <div id="question_2" class="answer collapse">
                <p>If you ever notice wrinkles on the edge of the head, simply use the included tuning key to tighten the tension rod closest to the wrinkle. You may need to loosen other rods if the wrinkle does not disappear with a few turns or if the rod seems to have no more room to tighten.</p>

                    <div id="question_3" class="answer collapse">
                        <p>A drum head can be kept clean by regularly wiping it with a dry cotton cloth or a feather duster to remove dust. If the drum head is coated, so that is has a white appearance, it can be cleaned with a soft cloth very lightly dampened with water. It should be noted that water or cleaner of any kind should never be poured or sprayed directly onto the drum head, regardless of the head type. This can cause severe damage to the head and ruin the display.</p>

                    <div id="question_4" class="answer collapse">
                        <p>Cleaning the shell of the drum is largely an aesthetic issue; it is still important as it prevents dirt build up inside the hardware such as the lugs. Cleaning the shell of a drum involves removing any large dust or debris particles first with a soft cotton cloth. Using the same type of soft cloth, you can properly dust the surface. For fingerprints, dirt, and other grime, a soft cloth dampened with a little warm water and mild detergent can be used to wipe down the shell. Rub the shell gently but firmly, using a circular motion to remove any remaining dirt, marks, or smears. With a dry cotton cloth, dry the shell completely. Anything other than softest cotton may scratch the surface of the shell, leaving unsightly marks behind.</p>

                        <p>We could, but we don’t. The prints need to cure. One of the most important aspects of printing decals like these is letting them “Outgassing“ No, not like your uncle Phil. The solvent inks need time to evaporate from the media, otherwise it can lead to bubbles and the adhesion issues.</p>

                        <p>Just like a “REAL” drum, the shells are made of wood.  We decided to do with a Birch as it serves the same purpose and keep the cost down for the consumer.</p>

                        <p>Technically yes. While it is for display purposes, we find saying that is like putting a guy in a fast car and saying drive slow. It just would not happen. That is why we took the extra step in laminating the decals. Not only will this provide a UV protection, but it also helps with scratches and scuffs.</p>

                        <p>That is a drum tuning key. You can adjust the tension rods in case you get wrinkles on the drum head, or when your girlfriend comes over you can swap out that Hard Rock display for something a bit more tame…. Like a picture of her and her dog dressed up in a dress…</p>
